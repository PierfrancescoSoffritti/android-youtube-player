<!-- 
This is a template for requesting new features / enhancements.

There is actually no special format required, but here are some
hints how you could describe or help us better understand your
idea.
-->

# Feature Request

### Describe your idea
<!-- 
Describe here your idea. Try to write your idea in a short 
and long version, so someone reading your short version understands
what you are asking for and a contributor knows with the long 
version what exactly you want to have at the end. 
-->


### Expected behavior and realization
<!-- Add here the expected behavior with optional screenshots, 
sketches or pseudo code that helps to understand how it could be
roughly implemented. -->
